# Triadic-Optimization
Inspired by the ancient Greek mathematician Aristarchus, implements a modern approach to simplifying and optimizing processes, with a focus on AI training. Drawing from Aristarchus's "Simple Method of Three," we aim to streamline complex methodologies into efficient and effective solutions for AI model development and training
