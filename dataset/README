EXAMPLE:

lines.txt is a clean utf-8 (ancient-greeks) txt file from Patrologia (Greek Christians Fathers).
Assume you want to use it for train an ai to speak ancient greeks but also speak like Orthodox Father.  
This file has 82440 lines. 

Step1. 
python3 make3.py

Step2.
rename 2.txt to dataset.txt (27480 lines)

Step3.
Merge 1.txt and 2.txt --> merged.txt

Step4
python3 merged5.py

output:(python3.11 merged5.py 
Data has been split randomly into val_data.txt (5496 lines) and test_data.txt (5496 lines).)


Finaly:
Use dataset.txt for train
Use val_data.txt for validation
Use test_data.txt for test_data

And train your model.
